**Overview**
This project utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for object detection in a parking lot scenario. It processes video footage to detect and track vehicles, highlighting specific areas of interest.

**Features**
Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8.
Mouse event tracking to capture pixel coordinates.
Polygonal area detection for identifying objects in a predefined zone.
Visual indicators for detected objects and their positions.
Integration with OpenCV and Pandas for frame processing and data handling.

**Technologies Used**
Python
OpenCV for image and video processing
YOLOv8 for object detection
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Computer Vision techniques
